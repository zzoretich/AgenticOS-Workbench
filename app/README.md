# AgenticOS Workbench — the app

The Workbench as a macOS app. The HUD in `../obsidian-plugin` runs in its own Electron window, compiled unchanged
against an Obsidian compatibility package (`compat/`), so the same source is the Workbench everywhere. The runtime,
the Claude Code and Codex plugins, the routines and the vault format are the ones in this repo.

Design and roadmap: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-workbench-app-design.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-workbench-app.md`. macOS only, built for Apple silicon.

To use it, download `AgenticOS-Workbench-<version>-arm64.dmg` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/zzoretich/AgenticOS-Workbench/releases/latest). This file is for running, testing
and building it from a checkout.

## Install and update (phase 5)

A packaged app carries the runtime in `Contents/Resources/payload`: a release tree (`scripts/make-payload.mjs`) with the
runtime's dependencies, from which the app runs `aos init` and `aos upgrade` with your own Node. With no install it
opens a setup wizard: it checks what `aos init` needs, offers a fix for each missing piece (run in a terminal inside the
wizard), asks for the hosts, the vault folder and the Chief of Staff, runs `aos init`, offers the `CLAUDE.md` line as a
diff, and opens the Workbench. With an install it opens the Workbench (attach mode), says once what changed, and offers
`aos upgrade` when it carries a newer runtime than the vault has. Plan:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-install-and-update.md`.

The app updates itself from this repo's GitHub Releases (electron-updater; a packaged release build only, and off when
`updates.check` is false or `AOS_APP_NO_UPDATES=1`). `npm run release:app` puts a release's app there.

## Run it from a checkout

Requires Node 22.12+. With an AgenticOS install the app reads the vault from `agenticos.json` (or `$AOS_APP_VAULT`);
without one it shows the setup wizard, which installs only when the run has a payload: `npm run payload`, then start it
with `AOS_APP_PAYLOAD=$PWD/payload`.

```sh
cd app
npm ci
node node_modules/electron/install.js   # Electron 44 fetches its binary on first use
npm start
```

Every Workbench surface writes to the vault, as the HUD always has; writes outside the surfaces in
`src/shared/surfaces.ts` are refused and logged. `AOS_APP_WRITE` narrows a run: `""` is read-only, `todo,chat` turns
on only those. The Term tab is a real shell: what you run there, or what a ❯_ button types for you, runs for real.

The page runs sandboxed, with context isolation and no Node. Every file it reads or writes, every process and terminal
it starts and everything it hands to the OS is a call over the preload's bridge (`window.aos`), which main checks
against the read scope, the write surfaces and the program rules (`src/main/policy/`). `../SECURITY.md` has the review.

A dev run keeps its data in `~/Library/Application Support/AgenticOS Workbench (dev)`, apart from an installed app's.
Run a second instance with `AOS_APP_USER_DATA=<another folder>`.

## Build a signed app

Needs a "Developer ID Application" identity in the login keychain, and a notarytool keychain profile.

```sh
APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=<profile> npm run dist                            # package, sign, notarize the app, build the DMG
APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=<profile> npm run dist:verify -- --notarize-dmg   # notarize and staple the DMG, verify both
npm run dist:test && npm run smoke:packaged                               # the smoke build, run on a synthetic install
```

## Layout

```
compat/          the `obsidian` module as the app provides it (the HUD imports it by that name)
src/main/        Electron main: window, menubar item, app menu, agenticos:// links, app://hud, vault watcher
src/main/ipc/    the bridge's handlers: sender check, zod schemas, a Result for every call
src/main/policy/ what the page may read, write, run and open (read scope, write policy, programs, shell, debug switches, setup)
src/main/setup/  the wizard and attach mode: login PATH, preflight, fix-its, aos init/upgrade from the payload, CLAUDE.md
src/main/updater.ts the app's own updates (electron-updater)
src/main/services/ the page's files, processes and terminals (node-pty), as main runs them
src/preload/     window.aos: the contextBridge of named functions, the page's only way into main
src/renderer/    boot, the HUD's host over the bridge, the POSIX path shim, host chrome, the setup wizard (setup/)
src/shared/      the IPC contract (no imports) and the write surfaces
scripts/         build, payload, compat tripwire, fixture generator, unit-test runner, live-vault driver, packaged checks, release
build/           the packaged app's entitlements and icon (electron-builder.yml is beside this file)
tests/           unit tests, and the end-to-end suite with its coverage map (tests/e2e/COVERAGE.md)
```

## Scripts

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | build, then open the app |
| `npm run build` | bundle main, the preload and the page into `out/` (a Node import from the page fails the build) |
| `npm run typecheck` | strict `tsc` over the app and the compat package |
| `npm run test:unit` | unit tests (the policies and services behind the bridge, the path shim, links, tray, menu, paths) |
| `npm run check:compat` | fail if the HUD uses an Obsidian API, DOM helper or icon `compat/` lacks |
| `npm run test:e2e` | build, generate the synthetic fixture vault, run the Playwright `_electron` suite |
| `npm run fixture` | generate the fixture vault alone (`tests/.fixture/`) |
| `npm run spike:screens` | drive the app on your real vault; screenshots and a report in `spike-output/` (never commit it) |
| `npm run dist` | build, then package, sign and (with `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE`) notarize the app and its DMG into `dist/` |
| `npm run dist:verify` | check the build's signature, entitlements, fuses, contents, notarization and DMG, and that it refuses a debugger |
| `npm run dist:test` | the smoke build in `dist-test/`: packaged like `dist`, ad-hoc signed, the one build that accepts the DevTools port |
| `npm run smoke:packaged` | run the smoke build on a fresh synthetic install, then once with no install (the wizard) (`-- --live`: on your vault, read-only; `-- --app <path>`) |
| `npm run payload` | build the runtime the app carries into `payload/` (the dist scripts run it first) |
| `npm run release:app` | for a tagged release: build, sign, notarize, staple, verify, and upload the DMG, the zip and `latest-mac.yml` to the tag's GitHub release (`-- --dry-run` prints the checks and the plan) |

`app/` has its own lockfile and is not an npm workspace, so the runtime's installs and the repo's other CI jobs never
pull Electron or native modules. CI runs all of the above on macOS (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job `app`).
