// The guard log. Main decides every write, spawn and read the page asks for (src/main/policy, phase 4); when it refuses
// one, the page records it here and throws Node's EROFS, as the write guards did when they ran in the page. The log is
// what the e2e suite and the packaged smoke read (window.aosHost.guard).
//
// The page keeps two questions of its own: whether the note editor may save a path, so a note it may not save opens
// without an Edit button; and whether a HUD surface's writes reach a path, so a button whose writes are off shows why
// instead of failing (Spaces' + to-do and Link to-dos… need the To-Do surface's writes, spaces-redesign D35). The host
// installs that rule (src/renderer/pagePolicy.ts); main still checks every write and every save.
