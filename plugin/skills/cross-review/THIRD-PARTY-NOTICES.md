## claudex-loop

This skill, `references/build.md` and the runner it calls (`brain/scripts/cross-review/runner.js`) are adapted from
**claudex-loop** by Chase AI, <https://github.com/chaseai-yt/claudex-loop>, at commit `8cf5e2c` (v2.1.0), used under
the MIT License.

What changed in the adaptation (design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-cross-review-design.md`):

- The Python runner is rewritten in Node on the AgenticOS seams: binaries from the recorded host paths, argv from
  `lib/headless.js`, every child with the AgenticOS hooks switched off.
- Review rounds are fresh, unsaved sessions carrying the prior round's findings (`--prior`) instead of resumed
  sessions, so no reviewer transcript lands in the host's session folders.
- Each call is gated by `crossReview.perDayUsd` and recorded in the spend ledger as `cross-review:<mode>`.
- A user with one CLI can ask for a same-provider review, labelled `same-provider` everywhere.
- Recon consults the vault's memory (`recall`, `feedback_rules`) when those tools are available.
- The `codex-review` and `codex-build` aliases, the legacy skills and the Windows launch paths are not carried over.
