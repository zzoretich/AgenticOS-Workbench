# UniDeX Spaces: pick up where you left off — design

**Date:** 2026-10-09
**Status:** approved 2026-10-09 in this condensed form (§2.1), on `feat/spaces-data`. *(user)* rows are the user's final answers; the rest are approved technical decisions. Mockups are private. Mechanics, edge cases, tests and docs in full: the plan's "Mechanics (moved from the spec)".
**Base:** `main` at `7fda846` (1.6.0 plus the §8 record). Runtime (`brain/scripts`, `cli`), HUD, the app's surface rules and `git.ts`; PR 3 also `app/src/main/services/sessions.ts`, compat's guard, `plugin/` and the generated `codex-plugin/`.
**Scope:** the Spaces tab (rail id `spaces`, `obsidian-plugin/src/views/SpacesTab.ts`) becomes where you pick a project back up: status board, dossier, launch pad. Code comments cite `spaces-redesign D<n>`.

---

## 1. Problem

At 7fda846, on a real vault:

1. **The counts are wrong:** every workspace shows `claude 0`. Vault-root sessions are skipped (`collectors/hostSessions.js:146`); cwds come from slugs that turn every `-` into `/` (`collectors/projects.js:55-71`), so names with `-`, `_` or `.` never match; `_worktrees` is collected as a workspace (`collectors/workspaces.js:318`), though its first level is a team or an item (`lib/team-run.js:132-133`; the older layout `:11`); the ignore list matches exact paths, so temp and scratch folders fill Outside (`hostSessions.js:145, :153-157`).
2. **The list is thin:** no search or filter, emoji dots (`SpacesTab.ts:14-16`), `_` folders listed, and the outside hint *moves* the folder (`SpacesTab.ts:110`, `cli/workspace.js:109-142`).
3. **The overview is empty:** five derived boxes (`SpacesTab.ts:157-200`); the README stub passes as a summary (`cli/workspace.js:64`); `next` falls back to the last commit subject (`workspaces.js:287`), in a vault-tracked folder a `vault backup:` timestamp; dated `HANDOFF-<slug>.md` files are never read (`workspaces.js:15` ranks only `HANDOFF.md`).
4. **No actions:** no new, adopt, archive, rename or resume; the header buttons spread out (`styles.css:1791-1793`).
5. **Disconnected:** git is `log -1` with its hash dropped (`collectors/util.js:105-118`, `workspaces.js:219-220`); no sessions, no links, and nothing opens Spaces on a workspace (`ui/PulsePopup.ts:179`, `main.ts:161-164`).

## 2. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rejected |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | *(user)* **Scope:** a redesign plus actions; Spaces keeps its rail slot and id. | A new tab. Folding into Pulse. |
| D2 | *(user)* **Three PRs, each shippable:** the data layer; the read-only redesign (Resume, deep links, today's writes); the actions. | One or two PRs. |
| D3 | *(user)* **Layout A:** list · dossier · right pane; the right pane folds under 1100 px, the list stacks under 760 px. | B timeline. C board first. |
| D4 | *(user)* **List:** search, + New, groups PINNED / ACTIVE / STALLED / IDLE, a hidden toggle, an Outside footer; rows show status, git, hosts, a live dot, next, counts. | Today's flat list. A sort menu. |
| D5 | *(user)* **Dossier header:** status pill with override, pin, a meta line (path, code folder, git); **Resume in Code** split button, Terminal, Finder, More ⋯. | Spread "<host> here" buttons. |
| D6 | *(user)* **Pick-up card:** rows *last*, *now* (handoff), *next*, *read* (insight, ↻), each naming its source. | An insight box. Prose. |
| D7 | *(user)* **Resume** opens a Code terminal in `ws:<name>` at the workspace's place (its code folder when linked), typing `claude --resume <id>` or `codex resume <id>`. A1: for Claude only, if a check run first in PR 2 shows `claude --resume` can't find a thread from another folder, it starts in the thread's start folder and the hint names it. Codex always uses the workspace's place (rollouts are global). | `claude --continue`, `codex resume --last`: not this thread. Always the start folder. |
| D8 | *(user)* **Overview · Files tabs.** Overview: Summary, Objectives with progress, Documents; typographic. | Five boxes. |
| D9 | *(user)* **Files and Map merged:** one tree with descriptions, NEW / CHANGED badges, filters, Describe N new, ↻ per file; the right pane previews. | A Map tab. |
| D10 | *(user)* **Right pane:** HISTORY (sessions, commits) over LINKED (to-dos, proposals, memory). | Live-now, insight stacks. |
| D11 | *(user)* **Status automatic + override** (§4); `workspace.md` may set active, paused or done; done offers Archive. A2: activity is attributed sessions and commits; in a vault-tracked folder a backup commit counts only if it changes a file the `aos workspace` verbs don't write (`workspace.md`, the stubs), so Pin or Draft never makes it active; document mtimes never count. | 14/60-day aging. A STATUS.md regex. Non-backup commits only. |
| D12 | *(user)* **Deep links both ways** via `WorkbenchView.open(target)` and `agenticos://workbench?tab=spaces&workspace=<name>`; a link only selects. | `setTab` alone. Code's text filter. |
| D13 | *(user)* **Draft workspace.md** in a review dialog; nothing is written until Save; later drafts touch only frontmatter. | A temp draft file. Write, then Undo. |
| D14 | **The draft's call:** one `provider.js` call (`workspace-draft`, strict schema) per explicit click, under the hook caps; else a labelled heuristic. | The reasoner. A config opt-in. |
| D15 | *(user)* **New space:** `workspaces/<kebab>` from Blank, Code repo or Clone from GitHub, with stubs; opened in Code; pinned. | A runtime `git clone`. |
| D16 | *(user)* **Adopt by alias:** `aliases:` records the folder, nothing moves; vanished folders can be hidden. | Moving from the page. |
| D17 | *(user)* **Archive, Restore, Rename:** Archive moves into `workspaces/_archive/`, restorable; Rename keeps history; app threads follow (renamed; read-only while archived). | The Trash. Threads on the old name. |
| D18 | **Pin and override live in `workspace.md`**, so they travel and either host can `set` them. | HUD settings. `brain/config.json`. |
| D19 | *(user)* **Feel:** typographic, `--udx-*` tokens, both themes, colour only for state; `.aos-spc-*`; DOM popovers. | Restyling shared classes. |
| D20 | **Attribution in the runtime,** first match wins, tagged `via` (§4). | Slug decoding. Start cwd only. |
| D21 | **The outside list** drops home, host config, temp folders and the vault outside `workspaces/`; rows gain `exists`, `match`, `git`. | Exact-path ignores. |
| D22 | **Hidden, not dropped:** `_` and `_archive/` entries carry `hidden: true`; `_worktrees` gets no entry; consumers filter on it. | Dropping them. |
| D23 | **`next` names its source** or stays empty; template text never counts; the insight's next stays on the insight. | The commit subject. |
| D24 | **Git state in the runtime,** own repo or `repo:` folder, never the vault's. | The app's `git.ts`. |
| D25 | **Session rows** (`sessions.recent`, ≤ 12) from an incremental cache, `brain/_index/session-index.json`. | The HUD reading transcripts. |
| D26 | **Live dot:** Code terminals and running Sessions threads in the workspace. | Claude's pid registry. |
| D27 | **Linked explicitly,** in the HUD: `#ws/<slug>` to-dos; proposals by `workspace:`, `target` or `recheck`; memory by `workspace:`, slug or path mention; each row says how. | Free-text names. |
| D28 | **CLI verbs** for every page action (§4), with `--json`, for either host's sessions. | HUD writes via Files. |
| D29 | **`spaces` gains argv rules only** (`writes: []`) and stays `verified: true`: a live check per host precedes PR 3's merge. | A new surface. |
| D30 | **Config `workspaces.*`:** `activeDays` 7, `idleDays` 30, `commits` 10, `recentSessions` 12, `ignoreCommitSubjects`, `attributeByFiles`; hidden paths per machine in `brain/_index/workspaces-hidden.json`. | Hard-coded. `brain/config.json`. |
| D31 | **Host off or not ready:** Resume is disabled with the reason ("… run aos init --host <h>", or not logged in); the split menu lists enabled hosts, a not-logged-in one disabled with its reason; New's picker offers ready hosts. | Throwing. The other host. |
| D32 | **Sessions lists app threads only;** its links are off, with the reason, for CLI threads or a hidden Sessions tab. | Listing CLI sessions. |
| D33 | **Map per provider:** `--file` is feature `file-map`; ↻ is off under `none`; Describe keeps the scan budgets. | Feature `unknown`. |
| D34 | **Host differences are recorded** (§5). | Weighting by host. |
| D35 | *(user)* A3: **Link to-dos…** (PR 3) suggests untagged to-dos naming the workspace; one click adds `#ws/<slug>` through the To-Do writer. | Hand tagging only. |

### 2.1 Decided 2026-10-09

The user answered A1 (D7) and A2 (D11) as recommended (A1 c, A2 a) and A3 (D35) yes. Approved with the spec: D14, D18, D20–D34, and these refinements: the Draft's Status starting on "auto (not written)", never model-proposed (D13); the insight's next in *read* (D23); thread rewrite on Rename, read-only archived threads (D17); "Link as code folder" beside Adopt (D16, D24); one 30-day count window (D34); Clone opening a shell, an agent only on "Start <host> here", New's host picker (D15); select-only links (D12); the PR 2 stand-ins.

## 3. What already exists (verified at `7fda846`)

- **Collector:** `scan()` attaches sessions (`scan-vault.js:64-71`) at SessionEnd on both hosts (`plugin/hooks/hooks.json:45`, `codex-plugin/hooks/hooks.json:103`); the insight's guess becomes `ws.next` (`scan-vault.js:412-414`).
- **Entries and verbs:** `workspaces.js:291-306`, status chain `:224-231`, manifest keys `:62-69`; `list`, `new`, `adopt` (`cli/workspace.js:16`); stubs write through links (`:71-87`).
- **Sessions:** slugs decoded (`hostSessions.js:38-55`) instead of `hostDirs` (`lib/host.js:46-60`); `lib/transcript.js` reads file tools (`:24`, `:123-125`); the team ledger lacks Codex ids (`team-run.js:368-383`). App threads name their workspace on line one (`sessions.ts:57`), resolved each turn (`:202`).
- **HUD:** `launchTerminal` takes `resume:{id}` (`WorkbenchView.ts:330-344`) and `launchArgs` builds both resume lines (`terminalLaunch.ts:343-353`), but only a new Claude conversation gets an id (`terminalLauncher.ts:226`) and the end bar resumes by id only for Claude (`TerminalPanel.ts:404`); Code groups by `ws:<name>` (`termGroups.ts:23-27`); compat has no `Menu` (`app/compat/src/index.ts:8-25`).
- **Page limits:** host session folders are list-only, outside code folders unreadable (`read-scope.ts:66-71, :79-86`); git runs unguarded (`git.ts:103-104`, `util.js:105-118`); the spaces surface has `writes: []` and three spawns, and `NAME` admits `..` (`surfaces.ts:183-194, :65`).
- **Models and links:** `provider.js` resolves ollama → claude → codex → none (`:233-274`); click precedent `briefing.js --force` (SECURITY.md:74). `todos.ts:64-73` parses tags; `Proposal` and `MemoryMeta` lack `workspace` (`proposals.ts:27-42`, `memories.ts:8-37`).

## 4. Design

**PR 1: data layer.** *After it ships:* real counts on both hosts, no `_` folders, a clean outside list, next steps from handoffs, the new status words, full `list --json` entries, hidden entries out of Pulse; insights regenerate once.
- **Seams,** the only host-data readers, per format: `host.js` `sessionFiles`; `transcript.js` `sessionHead`, `sessionTail`, `fileTouches`.
- **Attribution** (D20): (1) `app`, a Sessions thread; (2) `team`, a team-ledger session → its board item's `path`; (3) `cwd`, the start cwd inside a root (folder, `repo:`, `aliases:`), longest wins; (4) `worktree`, the main repo's root, or for a vanished seat the board, then name rules; (5) `files`, a vault-root session → the workspace its file touches hit most (≥ 3, no tie). `_worktrees` is never a target.
- **Resume:** `resumable: true` also needs a lowercase UUID equal to the file name's id; each `false` has a reason.

| Host | Row | `kind` | `resumable` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | `entrypoint: cli` | interactive | true |
| Claude | `sdk-*` | headless | false: "Headless run: open it in Sessions or start a new session" |
| Codex | `source` `cli`, `vscode` | interactive | true |
| Codex | `source` `exec` | headless | false until a PR 1 check shows it resumes |
| Codex | `archived_sessions/` | its source's | false: "Archived in Codex" |
| either | team seat | team | false |
| either | Sessions thread | app | opens it in Sessions |

- **Status:** **active**, activity (D11) within `activeDays`; **stalled**, a plan (a next step, handoff Now/Next or open objective) but nothing for 7+ days; **idle**, nothing for `idleDays` or no plan; the override wins. Sort: pinned; active, stalled, idle, paused, done; activity. Counts cover `idleDays` on both hosts.
- **`next`:** manifest → handoff Next → a Next heading → empty, with `next.from`; the model's next is `insight.next`. **Git:** a vault-tracked folder gets `{kind: 'vault'}` and path-scoped commits minus `ignoreCommitSubjects`. New fields: the plan, Mechanics › PR 1.

**PR 2: read-only redesign.** *After it ships:* three panes, pick-up card, Overview, merged Files, History, Linked, Resume, deep links. Stand-ins until PR 3: + New opens Code's sheet; static pill and pin; a read-only outside list; More ⋯ has Copy path, Reveal, Link code folder.
- **`resumeTarget`** → `{host, id, cwd, hint}` or `{disabled, reason}`: a UUID in this workspace's `recent`, `resumable`, host ready (D31), cwd per D7. *last* is the newest interactive or app row.
- **Deep links** select only after checks: `workspace` a snapshot name, `pane` from a fixed set, `thread` a ThreadId or dropped.
- **Terminals:** a host-neutral `sessionId`, so Codex terminals resume by id; `launchArgs` refuses a value starting with `-`.

**Accessibility:** list rows are buttons with `aria-selected`; groups are disclosure buttons; the split button has `aria-haspopup`; the progress bar is a `progressbar`; every coloured dot has a text label.

**PR 3: actions.** *After it ships:* New, Adopt or Link as code folder, Hide, Archive, Restore, Rename, Pin, Set status, Draft, + to-do and Link to-dos…, and the same verbs in any session on either host; `/todo`, `/propose`, `/project` link the workspace.
- **Page verbs** (rules on `cli/aos.js`, flags in fixed order): `workspace new KEBAB [--git] [--pin] [--empty] --json`; `draft WS --json` (fields and a `baseHash`; no workspace file written); `set WS --set JSON_OBJ --expect HASH [--dry-run] --json` (named keys only, refuses a changed file); `archive|restore WS --json`; `rename WS KEBAB --json`; `adopt PATH --into WS --json`; `hide|unhide PATH --json`. Terminals and sessions only: `list`, `which`, `stubs`, adopt's move form. No argument starts with `-` (`WS` an existing name, `KEBAB` a new one; regexes: the plan, Mechanics › PR 3 › Security).
- **Archive** moves the folder and map under `_archive/`, sets `archived:`, flips `status/active` → `status/archived` in project notes linked by `workspace:` or exact slug; threads stay, refusing turns until Restore. **Rename** moves folder, map and threads, rewrites thread meta, adds `aliases:`. **Clone** types `git clone -- '<url>' . && aos workspace stubs <slug> --pin` in a visible shell for a GitHub URL.

## 5. Host parity

1. **Entry point:** the Spaces tab; `aos workspace <verb>`; `/todo`, `/propose`, `/project` find their workspace with `which --json` on both hosts. No new command, skill or MCP tool.
2. **Hooks:** none change; SessionEnd already scans both hosts.
3. **Model calls:** the draft and ↻ per file, through `provider.js` per host (matrix).
4. **Session data:** runtime only, through the §4 seams; the HUD reads `snapshot.json`.
5. **MCP:** none.
6. **Degradation:** D31–D34 and the matrix: one 30-day window (Claude prunes at about 30 days, unverified); PR 1 adds Codex ids to the team ledger; a Codex resume keeps its own sandbox.
7. **Docs:** README, `docs/install.md` (Hosts paragraph, D34), `vault-template/AGENTICOS.md`, app-smoke per host and `## Codex host`, COVERAGE.

| Mode | How the user invokes it | What runs | What they see if it can't |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code only | The Spaces tab; `aos workspace …` in a session or terminal; `/todo`, `/propose`, `/project` inside a workspace | Claude transcripts; Resume types `claude --resume <id>`; Draft: Ollama, else Claude (`claude.model`, capped) | Codex rows: Resume off, "Codex is off on this machine: run aos init --host codex"; no New Codex session; headless rows: no Resume, with the reason; `none` or cap: a labelled heuristic |
| Codex only (plugin · direct) | The Spaces tab; `aos workspace …`; `$agenticos:todo`, `$agenticos:propose`, `$agenticos:project` (`$todo`… direct) | Codex rollouts and `session_index.jsonl`; Resume types `codex resume <id>`, as does the end bar; Draft: Ollama, a logged-in `claude`, else Codex (low effort, daily cap), labelled by who answered | Claude rows: Resume off, "Claude Code is off on this machine: run aos init --host claude"; no New Claude Code session; `exec` and archived rows: no Resume, with the reason; vault-root credit by edits only; writes outside the cwd may ask for sandbox approval (D34); `none`: the heuristic |
| Both | Both forms | Both formats; Resume uses the thread's host; the same 30-day window; Draft `auto` | A host not logged in: its Resume off with the reason; the other host's New offered |

Every differing cell is D31, D32 or D34; no parity gap widens.

## 6. Security

- **PR 1:** the map and regen rules (Spaces, Pulse) take `WS`/`REL` instead of `NAME`, checked again in the runtime (today `map-workspace.js ..` maps the vault root). Every git call runs `git -c core.fsmonitor=false -c log.showSignature=false -c core.untrackedCache=false --no-optional-locks` with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, so no repo config can run a program.
- **PR 3, the new power:** the §4 verbs (one model call for a draft) write only `workspaces/**` and `brain/_index/**`, plus one exception: the `status/` tag line of a project note D27 links by `workspace:` or exact slug, in `brain/memory/projects/`, if it exists and is no symlink. Folders move only between `workspaces/` and `workspaces/_archive/`; nothing is deleted. Resume and Clone are typed into a visible terminal (SECURITY.md:72).
- **Validation in the runtime:** names resolve to direct children of `workspaces/` (`_archive/` for restore); new names are free, not reserved and not `scratch`; paths are absolute or `~/`, outside the vault, not `/` or home itself, neither inside nor containing a host config folder, and (adopt, hide) equal a current outside row's cwd or (unhide) a stored hidden entry; `set` checks types, lengths and control characters; `--expect` refuses a changed file; writes are atomic and follow no symlink.
- **Refusals:** reserved names and `scratch`; a running team item or app turn; linked git worktrees; restore onto an existing name; moves under `AOS_HEADLESS=1`. Archive, Restore, Rename and Adopt ask in a `ConfirmModal`; Cancel spawns nothing.
- **No new IPC** (channel, preload, schema): verbs go `runAosJson` → `proc:spawn` → `WritePolicy.canSpawn`. **SECURITY.md:** a row for the verbs, a row for the draft, and the *Writes* and *Terminals* bullets (text in the plan).

## 7. Tests and docs

In full in the plan. **PR 1:** seam, attribution, status (A2's commit rule included), next, git-guard and name tests; new fixture workspaces and Codex rows; rehearsals assert claude ≥ 1 and codex ≥ 1. **PR 2:** `spacesModel` (D7's folder rule included), terminal and deep-link tests; the Spaces e2e rewritten; Codex-only variants; screens. **PR 3:** every verb and refusal, a containment test, fake providers per host, e2e per action, the live check per host.

## 8. Out of scope

CLI sessions in the Sessions tab, or a live CLI registry; `workspace:` on memories at `/wrap`; maps and the Files tree for code folders outside the vault; routines and team items in Linked, a workspace item in Needs you; insight changes beyond hash inputs and where their next lives (the daily age bucket stays); deleting a workspace; a release.
