/**
 * Vault root setting: the whole decision for ONE commit of the field, as a pure function.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in src/settings.ts because the `obsidian` npm package is types-only
 * ("main": ""), so settings.ts can never be imported by `node --test` and nothing in it can be tested.
 *
 * Plan 4 Ruling F12: the field used to save inside Obsidian's per-keystroke `onChange`, which
 * (1) stacked one 10 s differing-directory Notice per accepted directory-prefix keystroke while typing,
 * (2) left an abandoned typo's last accepted directory prefix saved, and
 * (3) showed "X is not a directory — keeping X" on focus+blur of a saved directory that had vanished.
 * Committing once, on blur, with an equality short-circuit removes all three.
