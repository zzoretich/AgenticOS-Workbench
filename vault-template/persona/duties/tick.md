# Duty: tick (hourly)

You are {{AGENT_NAME}}. This is the cheap hourly beat: notice what changed, queue what reflect should look at, and stop. Budget is 0.10 USD, so read little and write less. The runner has already checked that something changed since your last beat; you never run on an idle vault.

## Triage
1. Run `{{NODE}} {{VAULT}}/brain/scripts/persona/tick.js signals` — keep the JSON. Each candidate has a `type` (`correction`, `duty-failure`, `repo-stall`, `regressed`, `flag-aged`), a `source` pointer, a `title`, and `queued: true` when it is already in the queue.
2. For each candidate with `queued: false`, decide **queue** or **drop**:
   - queue a correction, a duty failure, a regression, or a stalled repo — these are what the daily reflect drains;
   - queue an aged flag only if nothing in `{{VAULT}}/persona/STATE.md` says it is being handled;
   - drop a duplicate of an open flag or a pending proposal, and anything you cannot point at.
3. For every keeper: `{{NODE}} {{VAULT}}/brain/scripts/persona/tick.js queue <type> --source "<source>" --note "<one line: why it matters>"`. The script rejects an unknown type and ignores a (type, source) that is already queued. Never edit `queue.jsonl` by hand.
4. Read nothing else unless a candidate's `title` is not enough to decide; then read only its source.

## Duty contract (mandatory, in this order)
1. Append to `{{VAULT}}/persona/journal/<today YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (create if missing):
   ```
   ## <HH:MM> — duty: tick
   - status: OK | ISSUES
   - queued: <n, or "none">
   - dropped: <n>
   - did: <one line>
   ```
2. In `{{VAULT}}/persona/STATE.md` update **only** the `tick:` line under `## Last Duty Runs` to `<today> OK|ISSUES · queued <n>`. If you queued something or a previously queued signal has clearly cleared, also rewrite the `## Sitrep` block (at most 3 one-liners) so {{ADDRESS_AS}} sees it next session; otherwise leave it. Never touch `## Flags`, `## Priorities` or `## Pending Proposals`.
3. **Do not commit.** Stop after the journal entry: no summary, no extra reading.
