# Duty: reflect-daily (nightly)

You are {{AGENT_NAME}}. Work only inside the vault at `{{VAULT}}`. This is the short nightly pass: read what the tick queued since the last drain, turn it into at most two proposals, and stop. Budget is 0.50 USD. The weekly reflect on Sunday curates the playbook and writes the reflection; you do neither. The runner drains the queue after your journal entry — never edit `persona/queue.jsonl` yourself.

## Gather
1. Run `{{NODE}} {{VAULT}}/brain/scripts/persona/reflect.js inputs --days 7` — keep the JSON.
   - `queue.byType`: the signals the tick queued (`correction`, `duty-failure`, `repo-stall`, `regressed`, `flag-aged`), each with a `source` pointer, the tick's `note`, and a `title` when the source is a note.
   - `ledger`: the track record. Never re-file a slug it lists as `open`, rejected or `dismissed`; a `regressed` slug is evidence the earlier fix was wrong.
   - `duties`: each duty's last run, exit and fail streak. `spend.perDuty`: runs and cost this week. `feedback`: memories and drafts written this week. `agentRuns`: sessions per day and how many did not end ok.
2. Read a queued signal's source only when its title and note are not enough to decide.

## Act
- A correction that appears more than once (queued twice, or a draft that repeats a memory's point) and is not yet a feedback memory: promote it — one file in `{{VAULT}}/brain/memory/feedback/` plus one line in `{{VAULT}}/MEMORY.md` under `## Feedback (how to work)`.
- Anything that needs a guarded change (a duty file, IDENTITY.md, a schedule, a persona script), or is an idea for {{ADDRESS_AS}}'s workflows or for the product: write `{{VAULT}}/persona/proposals/<today>-<slug>.md` following `proposals/README.md` — `kind` set (`self` | `vault` | `workflow` | `product`), `surface` set on a product proposal, a `recheck` recipe, What / Why / Risk / Premises. At most two proposals per night; prefer the signal that repeated. After each file: `{{NODE}} {{VAULT}}/brain/scripts/persona/ledger.js append filed <slug> --kind <kind> --by reflect-daily --target "<target>"`.
- A duty failure with a streak of 2 or more: propose the fix when it is guarded; otherwise write the exact command into the journal entry and do not run it.
- Everything else queued is drained without action; say so in the journal.

## Duty contract (mandatory, in this order)
1. Append to `{{VAULT}}/persona/journal/<today YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (create if missing):
   ```
   ## <HH:MM> — duty: reflect-daily
   - status: OK | ISSUES
   - did: <one line>
   - drained: <n signals, by type — or "none">
   - improved: <memory edits, or "nothing">
   - proposed: <proposal filenames, or "none">
   ```
2. In `{{VAULT}}/persona/STATE.md` update **only** the `reflect-daily:` line under `## Last Duty Runs` to `<today> OK|ISSUES · drained <n> · proposed <n>` and the `## Pending Proposals` list (the proposal filenames, or "none"). Never touch `## Sitrep`, `## Flags` or `## Priorities`.
3. **Do not commit.** Stop after the STATE.md edit: no summary, no extra reading.
