# Changelog

All notable changes to UniDeX (AgenticOS Workbench before 1.1). Versions follow the tags. From the next release on, each version's section is also its GitHub release notes, and an **Upgrading** subsection lists anything you need to do after `aos upgrade`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] — 2026-10-08

### Changed
- **Pulse is Home, and it is now a no-scroll cockpit.** Your Chief of Staff's briefing sits on top. Each underlined phrase opens what it names. "Since you last looked" says what arrived while you were away, and the Commands row sits underneath. Below are ten tiles: what needs you, system health, agents, workspaces, to-dos, decisions, notifications, routines, spend and memory.
  - A tile shows its count and as many rows as fit, and the rest read "+N more". Nothing scrolls, even at the smallest window.
  - A tile opens one popup with every area in a list on its left. Safe actions act right there: run a fix or a routine, mark read, tick a to-do, keep a memory. Decisions jump to their review (a proposal or flag to the flag-closer, a team gate to Agent Teams).
  - The pipeline LEDs, the Fix Queue, the cost and health rows and the auto-promote trail moved into the popup's Health and Memory areas.
  - The rail starts with Pulse, and its badge counts what needs you (rose when one is an error). Sessions is one click below.

### Added
- **The Chief of Staff writes a short briefing for Pulse.** A new `briefing` routine (every 30 minutes from 7:00 to 22:00) reads what Pulse knows: errors, decisions waiting on you, stale or failing work, unread notifications, to-dos, memories to review, routines and spend. When something changed, it asks the background model for two or three sentences in your Chief of Staff's name and saves them to `brain/_index/briefing.json`. It writes nothing when nothing changed. The call is a `duty:briefing` row paid from the daily duty cap (`persona.perDayUsd`), with `claude.model` (Haiku by default) or `codex.model`. Ollama is used first and free when it answers. Nothing runs while the Chief of Staff is off; `persona.briefing.enabled: false` turns just the briefing off. New vaults get the routine, and the upgrade turns it on for existing ones.

### Upgrading
- `aos upgrade` (and the runtime upgrade the app offers after it updates) adds the briefing routine, `brain/routines/briefing.md`, to a vault from before 1.5.0 and schedules it with your other routines. It spends only while the Chief of Staff is on. To keep it off, run `aos routines disable briefing`, or delete the file: a later upgrade does not add it back. If your routines were never scheduled, `aos routines sync` schedules them all.
- Whenever the routine is missing or the Chief of Staff is off, Pulse composes the paragraph itself, and **Turn on <name>'s briefing** in Pulse adds the routine back.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-10-08

### Changed
- **The composer (⌘L) sits under every running terminal,** a plain shell too: ⏎ runs what you wrote, ⇧⏎ adds a line, @ inserts a file and Snippets work; the / list stays with Claude Code and Codex.

### Fixed
- **Every tab keeps its own layout after a visit to the Term tab.** In 1.4.0 the Term tab left its layout on the Workbench's shared content area, so every tab opened after it was drawn in a row (lists beside their toolbars, Notifications and Proposals without their side list, To-Do in columns, Files' search and tree out of place) until the app restarted. Each tab now starts on a bare content area.

### Removed
- **The terminal on the Pulse tab.** Terminals live in the Term tab; the Pulse tab's ❯_ buttons and Commands still open it. The Embedded terminal panel setting is gone with it.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-10-08

### Added
- **Start Claude Code, Codex or a shell from anywhere, without picking a workspace.** ⌘T starts the host you used last, ⌥⌘1 Claude Code, ⌥⌘2 Codex and ⌥⌘3 a shell, from any tab. The Term tab's New button says what it will start and where ("New Claude Code · in Vault"); its ▾ menu lists every host, every place (what you have selected, the vault, Scratch, your workspaces, recent ones) and shows the exact command it will type. Terminals start next to what you are looking at (a selected workspace terminal, or the workspace open in Spaces), else in **your vault**. **Scratch**, a shared workspace at `workspaces/scratch`, is made the first time you pick it.
- **New workspace in one step.** ⇧⌘N, or a new name typed in the ▾ menu, makes `workspaces/<name>` with its README, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (and its own git repo, unless your vault's git tracks `workspaces/`) and starts the agent there. An existing name opens only when typed exactly.
- **Linked code folders.** A workspace's `workspace.md` can name the folder its code lives in (`repo: ~/Code/app`, or Spaces ▸ link code folder…): terminals started in that workspace start there, and sessions run there count for it.
- **The Term tab is a deck:** a list beside the terminal, one group per place (each workspace and Scratch, the newest launch first; then the vault, home and other folders), each row with the host's dot, the agent's title, where it came from and how it ended (✓ Done, Exited n). A group's + starts another terminal there; a filter narrows the list; Clear ended tidies it. The selected terminal's header shows its place (with Start here, Open a shell here, Make this a workspace…, Link a code folder…, Copy path), its host, model and access, and once it has ended Restart, Resume and Open a shell here. ⇧⌘[ / ⇧⌘] walk the list and ⇧⌘W closes a terminal (asking first while an agent runs). The Pulse strip keeps its tabs.
- **A composer under an agent's terminal** (⌘L): write a longer message, ⇧⏎ for a new line, @ for a file of the place (inside the vault), / for the host's commands (Claude Code `/name`, Codex `$skill`), and Snippets for prompts you reuse; ⏎ sends it as one paste. In Claude Code's own prompt, ⇧⏎ is now a new line too. Links in a terminal open: https in the browser, the agents' status-line links in the Workbench (a tab, or a note such as the flags in `persona/STATE.md`). The terminal sits in a padded card.
- **Find in a terminal** (⌘F on the Term tab): every match in the selected terminal, scrollback included, is highlighted and counted ("2 of 7"); ⏎ and ⇧⏎ step through them and Esc closes the bar. Switching terminals with it open finds the same words there.
- **Terminals show what runs in them:** each tab has the host's dot, the agent's own title (the conversation, as Claude Code and Codex name it), where it runs or which tab started it, and the agent's exit code when it ends. Spaces' workspace detail adds Claude Code here and Codex here.

### Changed
- Agents started from the Term tab, Spaces and the ❯_ buttons run with `exec` and a check that the CLI is there, so a missing `claude` or `codex` says "run aos doctor" instead of failing quietly. Access defaults to **Host default**: no flags, exactly as if you typed `claude` or `codex` yourself.
- Terminals start with your login shell's `PATH`, so an app opened from Finder finds `claude`, `codex` and the `node` an npm-installed CLI runs on.
- Terminals set `FORCE_HYPERLINK=1`, so Claude Code keeps the links in its status line (other tools that honour it print clickable links too).
- The Term tab and the Pulse strip keep the terminal you were on when you come back to them; the Shell and Working directory settings apply without a restart.

### Fixed
- "New terminal session" no longer opens two shells on an empty Term tab, and Spaces' terminal no longer hides behind the first session.
- The Files tab's New note, Rename and Move forms put the cursor in their field at once, so typing straight after opening one can no longer land in the other field.
- Editing a to-do no longer saves it halfway when TODO.md changes underneath (another HUD, `/todo` in a session, a sync): what you typed, the caret and the focus stay, and Enter saves onto the new file.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-10-07

### Upgrading
- **Updating from 1.3.0 or earlier:** the fix below works from the version that has it, so this one update still needs a hand: after **Restart to Update**, quit UniDeX with ⌘Q (or the tray's Quit) if it has not closed, and leave it closed for about 20 seconds while it installs and reopens.

### Fixed
- **Restart to Update quits the app.** Electron closes an update's windows before it emits `before-quit`, so the main window, which hides instead of closing until the app quits, cancelled the quit: the app stayed running in the tray and the installer waited for it. The app now marks itself as quitting first (and on Squirrel's own `before-quit-for-update`), so the update installs and the app reopens by itself.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-10-07

### Upgrading
- Accept the runtime update the app offers (or run `aos upgrade`): the model lists, access levels and Vault's host choice come from the runtime's `lib/host-catalog.js`, `lib/sessions.js catalog` and `sdk/ask.js`.

### Added
- **Each host lists its own models and commands.** The runtime asks Claude Code (one `initialize` request, no model call) and Codex (`codex debug models` and `codex debug prompt-input`) what they can run, and keeps the answer in `brain/_index/host-catalog.json` for a day. A host that does not answer keeps its aliases. The account details Claude Code sends with its list are never stored.
- **Access levels for a session turn:** read only (Claude plan mode, Codex's read-only sandbox), edit files (the default), or edit and run commands (Claude adds Bash; Codex always runs commands inside its sandbox).
- A session turn can change its model, effort and access from one turn to the next; each prompt in the thread records them. Codex turns take the `max` and `ultra` efforts.
- Plans: Claude's to-do list and Codex's `todo_list` become one `plan` event in the thread.
- The changes card's files carry lines added and removed (`git diff --numstat`, and an untracked file's lines).
- `ask.js --local --host=claude|codex --model=<id> --effort=<level>` answers a vault question on that host only, with no fallback to another provider.
- **A `/` menu in the Sessions composer** lists the host's commands (Claude Code's, inserted as `/name`) or skills (Codex's, inserted as `$name`); ↑↓ and Enter pick one, and the host runs it as typed.
- **A status line under the composer:** the next turn's model, effort and access, the turn's and today's session spend against the cap, and the workspace's branch and files changed.
- **Review changes +a −b** in the thread's top bar counts the lines added and removed and opens the changes card in a drawer; each file shows its own counts, and an edit line in the timeline its file's.

### Changed
- **The Sessions tab is laid out like Claude Code.** The list starts with **New session** and **Vault**, then each workspace with its threads (a host dot, a running mark, the age) and today's session spend. A thread reads as one column: your prompt, the agent's text, each tool call as a mono `Update(file)` / `Bash(command)` line with its result under it (click to open the input, the result and the file's diff), the plan as a card that ticks off, and `Working… (12s · esc to stop)`. **Stop** sits in the top bar, and Esc stops a running turn too.
- **One menu picks the host and the model.** `Claude Code · Opus 5.5 · High ▾` opens a host switch (a host that is off is greyed with why), search, the host's current models with older ones folded (Codex's configured model tagged "your default"), the model's effort levels, **Custom model id…**, and where the list came from with ↻. In a thread the host is locked, the model and effort apply from the next message (the list tags the model it ran on "used so far", and the timeline marks the change), and **New session on <other host>** starts one there. The app remembers the last host, access and each host's model and effort.
- **An access menu replaces Allow commands:** Read only, Edit files or Edit and run commands, with what each runs as on each host; on Codex the menu says commands always run inside its sandbox.
- **Vault chat has the same menu, always read only:** each question can go to any ready host and model (Claude Code through `claude -p`, Codex through `ask.js`; until you pick Codex there, a question takes today's route with its fallback, as the header says), and the footer shows today's reasoner spend against its cap.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-10-07

### Upgrading
- The repository is now **zzoretich/UniDeX-Agent-Harness**. Links, clones and the plugin marketplaces still reach it through GitHub's redirect, and the app keeps updating itself. A runtime from 1.2.0 or earlier, though, stopped seeing new releases when the repository was renamed: its update check met GitHub's redirect and gave up. If you use the app, accept the runtime update it offers after it updates to this release. Without the app, run `aos upgrade` once.

### Changed
- The repository is **zzoretich/UniDeX-Agent-Harness** (it was zzoretich/AgenticOS-Workbench). The app's update feed, its **UniDeX on GitHub** menu item, the update notice's release link and every install command in the docs use the new name.

### Fixed
- The runtime's update check follows a redirect (https only, at most three), so a moved repository no longer leaves it unaware of new releases.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-10-07

### Upgrading
- After the app updates itself, accept the runtime update it offers (or run `aos upgrade`): the Sessions tab runs each turn through the runtime's `lib/sessions.js`, and until the vault has it a session says "this vault's runtime has no sessions yet: run aos upgrade".

### Added
- **Session caps.** Settings ▸ Spend limits has a **Session turn cap** (`sessions.perTurnUsd`, $1.00) and a **Sessions daily cap** (`sessions.perDayUsd`, $10.00), and `aos status` shows today's session spend against it. The runtime can now plan, gate and read one turn of a Claude Code or Codex session (`brain/scripts/lib/sessions.js`); the Sessions tab that uses it comes with the next steps of UniDeX phase 2.
- The app can run a turn of an agent session in a workspace, read the workspace repository's changes and commit them (main's session and git services; the turn's spend and a row in Runs are recorded). Only a workspace's own repository counts: a workspace folder inside a vault kept in git has none, so Commit can never add the whole vault. They are on by default, after a live turn and a resume on each host.
- **The Sessions tab, in the Chat tab's place on the rail.** Its list starts with **Vault**, the chat about your notes as it was, then your agent sessions grouped by workspace, newest first, with a dot while a turn runs. **New session** picks a workspace under `workspaces/`, Claude Code or Codex (a host that is off is greyed out with why), an optional model and, for Claude, **Allow commands** (Codex runs commands in its sandbox). A thread shows your prompts, the agent's replies, each tool as one line that opens to its input and result, the files a turn changed, and each turn's cost (Codex's estimated); **Stop** ends a running turn. After a turn, a card lists what changed in the workspace's repository: **Review** shows a file's diff and **Commit** commits everything with a message you can edit. Nothing is pushed.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-07

### Upgrading
- The app is now called UniDeX, and this update renames it in Applications to **UniDeX.app**. After this one update it does not reopen by itself: open **UniDeX** from Applications or Spotlight. Your settings, vault and runtime carry over, and later updates reopen it as before. *(Corrected after the release: these notes first said the file kept its old name.)*

### Added
- **Light and dark.** The Workbench app now has a light theme as well as the dark one, and follows macOS's appearance as it changes. The sun and moon button at the foot of the ribbon, **Toggle light and dark** in the command palette and View ▸ **Appearance** switch it; App settings ▸ **Appearance** goes back to **Match macOS**. The choice is kept in the app's data and outlives a restart.
- **`statusline.chainPosition`** puts the status line you had below AgenticOS's lines instead of above them. It applies to `aos statusline install --chain-output`, which shows that line's first line: `aos config set statusline.chainPosition bottom` (or Settings → Status line). `top` is the default, and the change shows on the next refresh, with no reinstall.

### Changed
- **A new look, the first of three steps toward UniDeX.** The Workbench is monochrome (white on black or black on white) with colour kept for state: green ok, amber a warning, red breaking or failed, blue live or running, violet waiting on you, grey off. Agent Teams' gates are violet now, not amber. The scanline and glows are gone. Text is set in Inter and numbers and code in JetBrains Mono, both bundled with the app. The terminal, the memory graph and the disk chart follow the theme.
- **The Workbench's second UniDeX step: one rail.** The app's ribbon and the Workbench's top bar are gone. A single icon rail runs down the left: the UDX mark (Home), Search (⌘K) and Quick Capture at its head, every tab as an icon with its name on hover, and light and dark, App settings and Settings at its foot. Home is Chat when a provider is set up, else Pulse. Headings are sentence case without the `[ … ]` and `⌜ … ⌝` decorations; pills, cards and buttons are rounded; the fix queue marks each item with a dot in its colour; Agent Teams' gates have their own violet tone; Chat puts your messages in bubbles above a rounded composer. The clock went with the top bar.
- **Notifications is an inbox with a reading pane.** The list sits on the left and the item you open reads on the right, with its title, level, sender, sections and buttons; it stays open after it turns read, even in the Unread view it has just left. Clicking it again closes it.
- **Proposals reads the same way.** Pending, Backlog and History stay on the left; the proposal or backlog idea you open reads on the right, with its title and target above what it needs, What / Why / Risk and its premises. Runs and Memory keep their right-hand drawer, which does the same job.
- **The app is now UniDeX, the third UniDeX step.** The Dock, the menu bar, About, the window titles, the setup wizard, settings and the app's messages say UniDeX, and the icon is the UDX mark, white on black. The menubar item shows the mark too, as an image macOS tints for a light or dark menu bar, with its status beside it. The settings window's tabs are **App** and **Runtime**. The status line's update note reads `⬆ UniDeX <version>`, and `aos doctor` and `aos init` name the app UniDeX. The `aos` CLI, the `agenticos` plugins and MCP tools, `~/AgenticOS`, the app's data folder and the update feed keep their names, so nothing is reinstalled or re-trusted.
- The Claude Code and Codex plugins say UniDeX too: their descriptions, Codex's plugin and marketplace name, `/aos`'s description and a new vault's `AGENTICOS.md`. Only text changed, so the hooks you trusted stay trusted.

### Fixed
- Proposals' list fits its pane: each row puts the name on its own line and its kind, age and confirmations below it, so names no longer break mid-word and the history no longer scrolls sideways.
- A link in a note or a notification to a web page, PDF or image in the vault opens it with its default app, through the same rules as the Proposals tab's pages: an HTML page opens in the browser when it is under `brain/_index/` and is shown in Finder anywhere else. Before, the link opened the file as source text in a note, so a routine could not link a notification to the page it wrote.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-10-06

### Fixed
- A new vault's `AGENTICOS.md` fits the 9,000 characters the conventions hook injects into a Codex session again; it had grown past the limit, so Codex saw it cut off near the end. A vault you already have keeps its own copy.
- Agent Teams → Manage keeps the agent you picked in **Add a member** when the tab redraws before you click Add (its clock, a file change, the runtime's sweep). The pick came back empty, with Add disabled.
- **Settings** shows a change you make there once it is written. When the tab was still reading the settings as you changed one, it could go on showing the old value (and its "this vault" or "this machine" source) until you pressed ⟳ reload.

### Changed
- The app's setup wizard now leaves Ollama with its two models downloaded (`qwen3.5:9b` and `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`, about 7.2 GB): its Ollama fix, now **Install Ollama and its models**, also starts it and pulls them, and with Ollama already installed a missing model is a warning with its own fix, **Download the models**, that does not hold up the install. Background work runs on Ollama as soon as it answers, so before this a wizard install could leave it with no model to run. By hand: `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b && ollama pull qwen3-embedding:0.6b`.
- The Workbench's settings no longer mention Obsidian: the plugin section is "WORKBENCH — THIS APP", and the status bar, sidebar, vault root and terminal settings speak of the app.

### Removed
- The Term tab's **Install terminal support** and **Rebuild for this Electron** buttons, left from the Obsidian plugin. In the app they could only appear when a terminal failed to start, and led nowhere: the app carries its terminal.
- Two runtime scripts nothing ran: `graph-snapshot.js` (`aos graph status` prints the same) and `feedback-conflict-check.js` (the feedback-review skill checks for conflicts itself). A vault upgraded from an earlier release keeps its old copies, unused.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-06

**AgenticOS no longer uses Obsidian: the Workbench is a macOS app, AgenticOS Workbench, attached to this release.** Coming from 0.x with the Workbench in Obsidian? The [migration guide](https://github.com/zzoretich/UniDeX-Agent-Harness/blob/main/docs/migrating-to-1.0.md) walks through it.

### Upgrading
- Install the app: download `AgenticOS-Workbench-<version>-arm64.dmg` from this release (Macs with Apple silicon), drag it to Applications and open it. It finds your install through `agenticos.json`.
- Update the runtime: accept the app's **Update the runtime in your vault** (**Update now**), or run `aos upgrade` in a terminal. Then run `aos routines sync`: the upgrade records Homebrew's stable Node path in `agenticos.json`, and the sync re-renders your routine schedules with it.
- Quit Obsidian and remove the old plugin folder `.obsidian/plugins/agentic-os/` from your vault, after the app has opened it once (it copies your Workbench settings from there). `aos upgrade` mentions the folder while it is there and never deletes it.

### Added
- **The Workbench is a macOS app, AgenticOS Workbench**, attached to every release as a signed, notarized DMG for Apple silicon. The same HUD runs in its own window instead of inside Obsidian, with a note editor and a menubar popover; it is built from `app/` in this repository, with its full test suite in CI.
- **A Files tab** in the Workbench: the vault as a tree, search across notes (or every text file), Open file… and Search vault…, and a new note, rename, move and delete to the Trash: where you work with notes now.
- **The app installs AgenticOS.** Opened with no install, it shows a setup wizard: it checks Node, Claude Code and Codex (and their logins), Ollama, Python and uv, offers a fix for each missing one (Homebrew's installer, `brew install …`, `npm install -g …`, the logins), which runs in a terminal inside the wizard, then asks which hosts and which folder, asks the Chief of Staff questions in a form, runs `aos init` from the runtime the app carries, shows the `CLAUDE.md` line as a diff and adds it only if you say so, and opens the Workbench. No terminal needed.
- **The app opens an existing install as before**, says once what changed, and when it carries a newer runtime than your vault has, offers to run `aos upgrade` from it (never on its own: an upgrade re-renders your schedules).
- **The app updates itself** from GitHub Releases: it downloads a new version in the background and installs it when you quit, or at once from "Restart to update" (status bar, and AgenticOS Workbench ▸ Check for Updates…). `updates.check: false` turns it off, as it does the update check.
- `aos init` and `aos upgrade` run from a release tree that carries the runtime's dependencies (the app's bundled runtime) without npm: the dependencies are copied, then swapped in whole.

### Changed
- Your Workbench settings carry over to the app: the first time it opens a vault whose Workbench ran in Obsidian, it copies the settings from `.obsidian/plugins/agentic-os/data.json` into its own data folder (it never writes the vault's copy), so removing that folder loses nothing.
- The install checklist and `aos upgrade`'s line to an Obsidian-era vault name where to download the app.
- The Files tab and the note editor no longer create or change dot-files and dot-folders (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.mcp.json`, `.git/`, `.obsidian/`), which they never showed. Edit those in a terminal or another editor.
- Links into the Workbench are `agenticos://` links, which the AgenticOS Workbench app registers: `agenticos://workbench?tab=<tab>` from the status line, and `agenticos://note?file=<vault path>` for a note (the status line's flags link, and "Open in AgenticOS" on a proposal's page, which replaces "Open in Obsidian"). The Workbench still accepts the old `obsidian://agenticos?tab=<tab>` links.
- `aos doctor` shows the Workbench app and its version (`workbench app`, from `brain/_index/hud-host.json`, which the app writes each time it starts) in place of the `obsidian app` and `obsidian plugin` rows, and warns until the app has run once.
- Update notices count the app: the Workbench's version is the app's, read from that same file, no longer the Obsidian plugin's `manifest.json` in the vault. When the app is the part behind, the notice says to update the app (AgenticOS Workbench ▸ Check for Updates…) instead of `aos upgrade`.

### Removed
- Obsidian is no longer required or installed. `aos init` no longer checks for it, no longer installs the HUD into `.obsidian/plugins/agentic-os/` and no longer writes `.obsidian/daily-notes.json`; `aos upgrade` no longer replaces the HUD there; `aos config set dailyNote.layout` no longer rewrites Obsidian's Daily Notes setting. `--no-obsidian`, `--terminal` and `aos terminal install` are still accepted and do nothing (the app brings its own terminal).
- Releases no longer attach the Obsidian plugin (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`); they attach the app (the DMG, and the zip and `latest-mac.yml` its updates use). The Workbench's source stays in `obsidian-plugin/`, which the app compiles; its Obsidian manifest, `versions.json` and bundle build are gone.
- New vaults get no `.obsidian/` folder; an existing one is left alone.

### Security
- **The app's page runs sandboxed** (Chromium's sandbox, context isolation, no Node). The Workbench reads and writes files, starts the runtime and its terminals, and opens links only through a narrow bridge to the app's main process, which checks every call: files only in the vault, LaunchAgents, the app's own data and what the Workbench shows of the Claude Code and Codex folders (skills, agents, `agenticos.json`; never a credential file such as Codex's `auth.json`, never a session transcript); writes only where a Workbench surface writes; only the runtime's own commands, the user's installed `node`, `claude` and shells, with no environment of the page's choosing; links over https only. A file that would run when opened (a script, a `.terminal` or `.command` file, an app, a web page the runtime did not write) is shown in Finder instead, and a folder only ever goes to the Trash. Packaged builds refuse to start with a debugging switch. The review is in `SECURITY.md`.

### Fixed
- A Homebrew Node no longer breaks AgenticOS after `brew upgrade`. `aos init` and `aos upgrade` record Homebrew's stable link (`<prefix>/opt/<formula>/bin/node`) instead of the versioned `Cellar/` path, which `brew upgrade` deletes, and the schedules use it too. `aos doctor` warns about a `Cellar/` path still recorded.
- A Workbench drawer's ✕ no longer sits under the scrollbar macOS shows after the drawer scrolls, where a click hit the scrollbar instead.
- On a machine without Codex, the Routines tab no longer asks the runtime for Codex's automations every minute while it is open (each ask raised a notice). It asks only where Codex is a session host.
- The nightly and weekly reflect duties can promote a repeated correction into a feedback memory again. Since the duty write scope (0.14.0) they were refused `brain/memory/feedback/` and `MEMORY.md`, journaled the block and raised a flag in `persona/STATE.md` on every run that tried. Both duties now get those two paths, and nothing else in `brain/memory/`. Codex cannot grant a single file at the vault root, so after a clean reflect run the runner adds the `MEMORY.md` line of each new feedback memory the duty did not index, on both hosts.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-09-28

### Added
- **The status line** (`aos statusline install`, opt-in). Claude Code gets three lines: model and effort, the task in progress (else the GSD phase), branch and PR; context, rate limits, cost, prompt cache and lines changed; and, only when something needs you, the gates waiting on you, unread breaking news and alerts, open flags, a live agent-team run, the spend nearest its daily cap, an update, a provider that fell to none or an unwrapped session, each a link to the Workbench tab that handles it. The status line you had is recorded and chained (it still runs, with the same input) and `aos statusline uninstall` puts it back, byte for byte when nothing else in the file changed. Subagents get their own rows. Codex runs no status line command, so install writes a preset of its built-in items into `config.toml`, never over one you set without `--force`, and what needs you is printed at session start. `aos doctor` and the next session start say when another installer took the slot; `aos upgrade` keeps an installed line pointed at the current runtime and never takes a lost slot back. Settings: `statusline.segments`, `statusline.links`, `statusline.subagents`, `statusline.refreshSeconds`, `statusline.codexItems`.
- `obsidian://agenticos?tab=<tab>` opens the Workbench on a tab.

### Changed
- The Obsidian status bar shows what needs you (gates, alerts, flags, a live run, spend near its cap, health), each opening where it is handled, instead of inventory counts; a vault whose runtime predates the status line keeps the counts.

### Fixed
- Opening a Workbench tab from a command or link right after Obsidian starts (a deferred leaf) now lands on that tab.
- `idle` in the Obsidian status bar is dimmed.

## [0.20.3] — 2026-09-28

### Changed
- The Agent Teams tab hands the next step to the team's lead. After you approve a gate, or raise the budget of a paused item, the tab opens the lead in the terminal with a prompt saying what you decided, that it is already recorded, and how to run `aos team` for this vault: its agent on the lead's own provider when that host is enabled and has it, else another enabled host. The Approve dialog says where it opens; where no enabled host has the lead's agent, a plain session opens, told which lead to act as and where the team's rules are. If no terminal can start, the command is copied to the clipboard and shown in a notice that stays until you dismiss it. The lead still picks the next seat; the tab never dispatches one. Before, the item waited with the lead as its owner until someone started the lead.

## [0.20.2] — 2026-09-28

### Changed
- Update notices count the Workbench. The installed version was the lower of the Claude Code or Codex plugin and the vault's runtime, so a Workbench an upgrade could not replace looked current. It now also counts the Obsidian plugin's own `manifest.json` in the vault, read at every check and session start: the notice names it ("plugin 0.20.1, vault 0.20.1, Workbench 0.20.0"), and the statusline and the Workbench's update badge stay on until it is replaced. A Workbench whose `manifest.json` is missing or invalid counts as an incomplete install ("Workbench incomplete"), and `aos upgrade` refreshes the update check before rescanning, so the badge is right as soon as it finishes. A vault without the Workbench (`aos init --no-obsidian`) is judged as before.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-09-28

### Fixed
- `aos upgrade --from-local` no longer installs an old Workbench. The Obsidian bundle's `main.js` is a build output kept out of git, and the upgrade built it only when it was missing, so a checkout holding one from an earlier build installed that old code beside the new `manifest.json` and `styles.css` (0.20.0 showed no Agent Teams tab). A checkout with its dependencies installed now always rebuilds; a `main.js` older than the plugin's sources is never installed, and the upgrade says why and tries the release bundle instead.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-09-28

### Upgrading
- Add `persona/teams/*/running/` to your vault's `.gitignore` (new vaults get it): a live agent-team run's marker exists only while the run is going.
- Add `*.lock` and `*.tmp` to your vault's `.gitignore` (new vaults get them): a writer's lock and temp files exist only for the moment of a write, but an auto-backup at that moment would commit them.

### Added
- **Agent teams** (`aos team`, `/team` · `$agenticos:team`): named teams in `persona/teams/<team>/` with a roster (`TEAM.md`), a work board, a team thread and a run log. A lead moves items through stages and gates and dispatches headless seats, each in its own git worktree, on the provider its `TEAM.md` row names; a reviewer marked `opposite` runs on the provider that did not build the work. Gates, budgets, pausing and roster changes are the user's decisions and are refused under `AOS_HEADLESS=1`, and every board write can be a compare-and-set with `--expect`. A killed run still leaves a trace (a live-run marker, signal traps, a sweep), `dispatch --detach` hands a run to launchd or a systemd user unit, and `aos team wait` tells a lead's caller when a run ended. Spend is recorded as `team:<team>:<member>` (Codex priced from tokens), shown by `aos status` and kept out of the hook cap; each item's phase budget caps its Claude spend. A team's lead joins the Runs tab's orchestrator roster, so its seats roll up under it. `aos team init` seeds an example team. Only a clean, successful seat run merges into the item's trunk; the lead takes held work with `aos team merge`, and parallel seats split an item's budget with `--max-usd`.
- **The Agent Teams tab** in the Workbench (⁂, after Agents): the gates waiting on you across every team come first, each with the lead's case, the spend, budget presets and − / +, **Approve** and **Redirect** (which opens the lead in the terminal to take your note). Then one team at a time: its work board by stage, with each item's detail, posts, runs and budget; its roster, with what each member is doing and a button to talk to it on each host; its channel, with a message box to the lead; and Manage, where provider, model and effort are pickers, pausing is a switch, and members are added from your agents. The tab reads `persona/teams/` itself and writes only through `aos team`, sending the state it showed so a stale card is refused, and the rail badge counts pending gates.
- `summary.everyPrompts` (default 10) and `summary.minMinutes` (default 15): how often the working-memory summary refreshes BRAIN.md's Last Session, as pickers in ⚙ Settings → Memory & scanning.

### Changed
- `aos team list` lists a team whose `TEAM.md` cannot be read as a row with its error instead of failing, and `aos team list --json` names the presets `aos team set` accepts.
- The `feedback_rules` MCP tool returns an index of the active rules (path, title, one-line description, updated), newest first; `full: true` adds each rule's text and `limit` keeps the newest. On a vault with 70 rules one call went from about 20k tokens to about 5k. `feedback-review` asks for the text; `cross-review` reads the index and then only the rules it needs.
- `memory_list` returns the same kind of index grouped by type, with `type` and `limit` filters, instead of every memory's frontmatter; `session_recall` cuts a daily note at `maxChars` (default 24,000) and says how to read the rest. Every MCP tool's JSON is compact.

### Fixed
- A row appended to a log whose last line has no newline (a crash mid-append, a hand edit) is no longer joined to that fragment and lost with it: every JSONL writer now starts the row on a line of its own. On a team board this was a gate approval that reported success while the gate stayed pending.
- Files the runtime changes from several processes at once no longer lose a write. `routines.json` (a routine's run against `aos routines sync`, which wrote back a state it read before installing the schedules), `MEMORY.md`, `SESSION.md`, BRAIN.md's Last Session (against the BRAIN.md compile) and the daily note are now changed under a lock, as they are at that moment; every writer that used a shared `<file>.tmp` has a temp name of its own.
- A session's cost is counted once. The cost sync used to rewrite `runs.jsonl` to patch the whole session's cost into every row of the session, so a session with two runs counted twice ($213 on one vault), and a run that ended while it rewrote the file could be lost. Costs now go to their own log, `brain/_index/agent-runs/costs.jsonl`, and `runs.jsonl` is only ever appended to (retention prunes both under a lock the writers wait on). The Workbench's Runs tab, Cost panel, Fix Queue and the monthly budget read the two together: the session's cost on its latest run, its earlier runs at $0 pointing to it. Rows costed before this release are read the same way; nothing is rewritten.
- One session no longer turns into several runs, each wrapped as if it were the whole session. The Workbench's load-time sweep read the telemetry hook's own process id, which is always gone, so it marked every session idle for 5 minutes "crashed", and the session's next tool call started a new run. The plugin now runs the runtime's own reconcile instead (idle past `telemetry.staleAfterMinutes`, or a Codex process that exited). A session that goes on after its run was closed is recorded as a second segment with its own run id and timeline instead of overwriting the first, and auto-wrap keeps a per-session offset, so a later wrap of the same session extracts only what is new and skips when nothing is.
- The working-memory summary ran every few minutes in a busy session and not at all in the next one. It counted every user-role entry, and Claude Code writes each tool result and slash command as one (43 for 2 prompts in one transcript), against a single marker per day shared by every session. It now counts only the prompts you type, keeps one marker per session on both hosts, and runs every 10 prompts at most every 15 minutes.
- `feedback_rules` and `memory_list` no longer return the correction detector's unreviewed drafts (`brain/memory/feedback/_drafts/`) as rules and memories.
- The terminal no longer leaks listeners. Every visit to Pulse or Term left three terminal-pool listeners behind for as long as Obsidian ran, and a closed panel kept redrawing its tabs; each panel now removes its own when it closes.
- The Pulse command deck's `/reflect` only printed a prompt meant for a session and wrote nothing. It is now `/reflect-week` and writes this week's reflection to `brain/reflections/` in one click through the model provider (the reasoner model, within `reasoner.perCallUsd` and `reasoner.perDayUsd`); the notice shows the saved path, or why no model was available.
- The deck's `/remember` and `/pattern` filed a feedback memory. `/remember` now adds the note to `SESSION.md` with `#promote`, under "Things to Remember" (or "Promote to Memory on Close" for a `feedback:`, `project:` or `pattern:` note), and `/pattern` adds a pattern to `brain/patterns/<area>.md`, listing a new area file in `MEMORY.md`, the same as the in-session `/remember` and `/pattern`.
- A deck command that reports on stderr (as the runtime scripts do) shows that line in its success notice instead of "ok".

## [0.19.2] — 2026-09-24

### Fixed
- BRAIN.md no longer stops updating when active projects outgrow its 850-token budget. Session-end extraction files every new project as active, and the compiler used to fail once they crowded out the "Last Session" block, so every session started with the old BRAIN.md. It now lists active projects newest first (by `updated`), keeps as many as fit, and ends the list with "…and N older active projects" pointing at `brain/_index/MOC-projects.md`. Only pinned rules that overflow on their own still fail the build. The pipeline ledger records the count as `activeProjectsOmitted`.
- ⚙ Settings' Codex model pickers now list the models your Codex offers (GPT-6 and GPT-5.6 included), read from Codex's own `models_cache.json`, which Codex keeps current; without a Codex cache they fall back to the pricing table's list.

## [0.19.1] — 2026-09-24

### Fixed
- ⚙ Settings said "no `aos config`, run `aos upgrade`" on 0.19.0: `aos` exited before a pipe had taken all its output, so the Workbench read `aos config list --json` cut off at 64 KB. Every `aos` command now exits only after its output is flushed, and the tab names the real reason when the output does not parse.

### Added
- Duty model and effort are settings: `aos config set persona.model <model>` and `aos config set persona.effort low|medium|high`, then `aos routines sync`. They win over the interview's answers, which stay the fallback; the Codex duty model stays `persona.codexModel`.
- One duty can run on its own model: `model:` and `effort:` in `brain/routines/<duty>.md` override the schedule's for that duty (for example the hourly tick on `haiku`, the weekly reflect on a bigger model). The Workbench Routines tab accepts them too.

### Upgrading
- Nothing to do. To move the duties to another model, set `persona.model` and run `aos routines sync`; raise a duty's `budgetUsd` in its routine file if the new model costs more per run (the hourly tick's is 0.10 USD).

## [0.19.0] — 2026-09-24

### Added
- ⚙ Settings has no text boxes: every setting is a toggle, a preset picker, chips or a button. Numbers also step with − / + to the next preset; model pickers list each host's models (Codex's from its pricing table); lists are chips; `quickLinks`, the roster and external labels open `brain/config.json`, and skill and agent exclusions open their tabs. A value set outside the presets is shown as "(custom)" and never changed by opening the tab; set any value with `aos config set`. Obsidian's own settings pane gets the same pickers.
- `aos config list --json` rows carry `choices`, `unit`, `pick` and `editIn`.
- **Notifications.** Agents, routines and duties on either host post with `aos notify post`. Each post is a Markdown note under `brain/notifications/`, with a level (`breaking`, `alert`, `edition`, `info`), optional tags and allow-listed actions.
  - A new Workbench **Notifications** tab lists the items with an unread badge (rose while a breaking item is unread), filters by view, level and sender, and read, archive and open-note controls.
  - Actions: **ask** runs a named skill in a new Claude Code or Codex session, and **react** records a +1/−1 the sender can read back.
  - `breaking` and `alert` items raise a desktop notification.
  - `/notifications` (Claude Code) and `$agenticos:notifications` (Codex) do the same from a session.
  - New settings: `notifications.osAlert`, `notifications.retentionDays` and `notifications.maxPerSenderPerHour`.
  - `recallRoots` now includes `brain/notifications`, so past items are searchable.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-09-24

### Added
- ⚙ Settings, pinned to the bottom-left of the Workbench rail: every setting of the whole system in one tab, built from `aos config`. Master switches head it; each row shows where its value comes from (this machine, this vault or the default), when a change applies, and a ↺ to go back to the default; spend limits show today's spend against the cap. A change runs `aos config set`, so a refused value is explained under its field; raising spend or widening an agent's autonomy asks first; a step a change leaves (`aos routines sync`) waits as a button, counted on the ⚙ badge. Also "Open Workbench: Settings" in the command palette and a button in Obsidian's settings pane.
- `aos config list --json` rows carry `host` (a Claude- or Codex-only setting) and `spentToday` (on each daily cap).

### Changed
- The HUD's Cost and Telemetry toggles are now the system's own switches, `cost.enabled` and `telemetry.enabled`: turning Telemetry off stops the hooks recording, not just the HUD's view. The old HUD-only values are dropped from the plugin's `data.json`.
- The Workbench rail scrolls its tab buttons when the pane is short, so none is cut off.

### Upgrading
- If you turned the HUD's Cost or Telemetry toggle off without changing the system setting, check ⚙ Settings once after upgrading: the HUD now shows what the system does.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-09-24

### Added
- `aos config list | get | set | unset`: every setting in one place, with the file each value comes from. `set` validates the value, writes it atomically to the file that actually wins the merge, and runs the side effects the change needs. It works from a terminal, from `/aos config` in Claude Code and from `$agenticos:aos config` in Codex. First step toward the Workbench Settings tab.
- `aos doctor` has a `config` row that flags unknown keys (typos) and invalid values in `agenticos.json` and `brain/config.json`.

### Changed
- `persona.enabled` set through `aos config` is the whole Chief of Staff switch: `false` also pauses scheduled duties (`persona/DISABLED`). `aos persona on|off` still pauses duties alone.
- `scan.autoSweepOrphans` in the vault config now turns the orphan sweep on; a boolean in `brain/_index/scanner-config.json` still wins.
- Every writer of `agenticos.json` and `brain/config.json` (`aos provider`, `aos cost`, `aos graph`, `aos persona`, init and upgrade) writes atomically, so a hook never reads a half-written file.

### Fixed
- A daily cap of `0` now means no spend for `codex.perDayUsd`, `reasoner.perDayUsd`, `graph.semantic.perDayUsd` and `crossReview.perDayUsd`, as it already did for the Claude, persona and routine caps; it used to fall back to the default.

### Upgrading
- Run `aos upgrade`; until then the launcher answers `aos config` with `unknown script config`.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-09-23

### Changed
- Release notes come from this CHANGELOG; a release builds in a read-only job and publishes from a separate one, and every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit (#41).
- CI type-checks the HUD, lints the JavaScript (eslint) and the shell scripts (shellcheck), and runs every suite in two extreme time zones with host variables exported (#41).

### Fixed
- Codex sessions now close in telemetry as soon as the Codex process exits, instead of waiting out the stale-session timeout (#40).
- The MCP server reports the release version instead of 0.1.0: the runtime's own `package.json` is now bumped with every release (#41).
- An accepted proposal's own sub-headings now nest under its What and Why in `persona/backlog.md` (#41).

## [0.15.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- Universal agents: an Agents tab and one agent set for both hosts (#39).

## [0.14.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- Universal skills: a Skills tab and one skill set shared between Claude Code and Codex, synced automatically each session (#38).

### Security
- Private terms used by the privacy gate (names, paths, and other sensitive identifiers) now load from a local, gitignored file instead of shipping in the repository (#35).
- Chief of Staff duties can now write only inside their own scope — journal, state, proposals, and similar files — on both hosts, closing a path for a prompt-injected duty to edit scripts or trust files (#36).

### Upgrading
- The privacy fix above required rewriting and force-pushing this repository's history to purge terms that had already been committed. If you cloned before this release, discard that clone and clone again — a pull will conflict.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- Cross-review and handoff: Claude Code and Codex can review each other's plans, or hand off a task to the other model, on both hosts (#34).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- The vault graph's daily semantic pass now also runs under Codex (#32).

### Fixed
- Skills, `aos upgrade`, `aos status`, and on-screen text now name the host you're actually using under Codex instead of assuming Claude (#30).
- The reasoner role and structured tool-call requests now work correctly under Codex (#31).
- Cost tracking and the file/session inventory now follow whichever host you're on (#33).

## [0.11.3] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- `aos upgrade` now follows a marketplace that was added from a local checkout (#29).

## [0.11.2] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- The vault graph's semantic-pass timestamp now survives a structural-pass rebuild (#28).

## [0.11.1] — 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- The vault graph's lock is no longer broken while its owner process is still alive (#27).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- `aos init` installs a pinned graphify and builds a structural vault graph on every scan (#24).
- `graph_*` MCP tools and a graph skill for querying the vault's structure (#25).
- A daily semantic pass enriches the vault graph, metered on its own spend budget (#26).

### Upgrading
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) if you don't already have it. `aos init` now requires it, and `aos upgrade` will warn — without failing — that graphify can't install until it's present.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- AgenticOS ships as a Codex plugin as well as a Claude Code plugin (#23).

### Upgrading
- An existing Codex install that used the old direct hook wiring moves over to the Codex plugin automatically on your next `aos upgrade`. Review and trust the new hook entries once under `/hooks` in Codex; that trust then survives future upgrades.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-09-23

### Security
- Recipe guard: proposal recipes now run only inside a read-only grammar, limiting what an auto-applied proposal can do (#22).

## [0.9.1] — 2026-09-23

### Added
- Every proposal now gets its own page in the Proposals tab, in one format, with an HTML page (#21).

### Fixed
- Duty date placeholders now fill with the local day (#20).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added
- Proposals tab in the HUD, with rail count badges (#18).
- To-do tab and `/todo` command (#19).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-22

### Changed
- Obsidian, Ollama, and python3 (3.9+) are now mandatory prerequisites of `aos init`; `--provider none` no longer waives them (#15).

### Upgrading
- Obsidian, Ollama, and python3 (3.9+) are now required. `aos upgrade` itself won't fail if they're missing, but `aos doctor` will start reporting them as failures, and running `aos init` fresh will refuse to proceed without them.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-22

### Added
- Host routines: Codex Automations and Claude Code cloud routines now appear in the Routines tab (#7).
- Persona heartbeat watchdog and a proposal outcome ledger (#8).
- Hourly "tick" duty with a heartbeat pill in the HUD (#9).
- Nightly reflection, an idea backlog, and an early-reflect trigger (#11).
- Earned autonomy for the persona: recheck confirmations, class stats, and auto-applied proposals once trust is earned (#13).
- Codex parity: one vault now works from either host, auto-detected, with session reconciliation for Codex's late `SessionEnd` (#14).

### Fixed
- Raised the tick duty's daily budget to $0.10 (#10).
- Reflect and ledger scripts now also accept vault-relative paths (#12).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added
- `workspaces/` becomes the tracked home for Claude Code and Codex projects, with an `aos workspace` command to create or adopt one and per-workspace session counts in the HUD (#6).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added
- Codex CLI can now be used as a session host, alongside or instead of Claude Code (`aos init --host codex|both|auto`) (#5).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added
- Routines tab: recurring actions defined as files, run by one scheduler, surfaced in the Workbench (#3).

### Fixed
- `aos upgrade` now runs the checkout's own CLI instead of a stale copy already in the vault (#4).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-21

### Changed
- The workhorse model moves to qwen3.5:9b, and the reasoner role now uses Claude Opus 5 by default instead of a local Ollama model; gpt-oss is retired (#2).

### Upgrading
- `ask`, `reflect-week`, `consolidate-memory`, and the HUD Chat tab now reason through hosted Claude Opus 5 by default, falling back to the local workhorse only if Claude is unavailable. Spend is capped by a new `reasoner` config block and shown as its own line in `aos status`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added
- Sidebar HUD shows an update-available pill, next to the update notice already printed at session start.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-15

The first public release: an `aos` CLI, the AgenticOS runtime, a Claude Code plugin, and the Obsidian HUD.

### Added
- `aos` CLI: `init`, `doctor`, `status`, `provider`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`, `terminal`, `persona`, and `cost` subcommands, plus a vault template (seed tree, AGENTICOS.md, Obsidian seeds).
- Claude Code plugin: marketplace manifest, 14 slash commands, hooks, and the `agenticos` MCP server.
- Provider system that auto-resolves between a local Ollama model, headless Claude, or none, with a spend ledger and daily/per-call caps.
- Memory pipeline: the `wrap_session` tool, auto-wrap, and heuristic (or model-backed) summarization of working memory, file maps, and workspace insights.
- Persona ("Chief of Staff"): an identity interview, scheduled duties with launchd/cron templates, persona-flag-closer and persona-sitrep skills, and a cost analyzer.
- Obsidian HUD plugin: a dashboard reading vault and config state, a pipelines view, budget and cost tabs, and a provider-aware Chat tab.
- Opt-in in-HUD terminal, built from source on install.
- Update notifications: a GitHub release check surfaced as a session-start notice.
- Docs: README, install guide, and a release acceptance runbook.
